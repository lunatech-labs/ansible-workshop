# Ansible workshop

This is the Ansible workshop repository.

- On `docs` you can find the material presented during the sessions.
- The `examples` folder contains the solution to the exercises proposed in the keynote. Remember that more than one solution is valid, so if your proposal doesn't match the one given a solution, it doesn't mean that is wrong ;). And what is more important, try always to solve it on your own before checking the solution!
